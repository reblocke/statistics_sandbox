      " Hey everyone, we'll go ahead and get started. My name is Brian Locke. I'm one of the assistant professors in STICU in the Schmidt Chess Clinic. And I'm going to be giving an update on hypercapnic respiratory failure. I do have a conflict of interest with a local startup that's doing machine learning unrelated to this talk. A few folks I'd like to acknowledge in supporting this work, the American Thoracic Society, the NIH, and then I do have a pulmonary critical care medicine seed grant that I'll talk about some of what we're up to with. And then using the Utah Population Database. And so thanks to the funders of that. Of note, for folks who are using this notebook, LM, which it's one of Google's large language models where you can give it resources and it sort of synthesizes them and goes through it. So I put a bunch of the literature that supports this body of work on there. So as you're listening along, you should be able to ask questions or look at the synthesis on there. So hopping into things. So as I mentioned, I wanted to give a bit of background on sort of hypercapnic respiratory failure in the current state as the first part of this talk. And then a little bit on what we're up to research and clinical wise. And then I'll end talking a bit about new CMS national coverage determinations for respiratory assist devices and home mechanical ventilators, which most of the private insurance will also be following suit soon. So new information on how to get patients qualified for devices. I think it's probably worth spending just a quick moment on definitions. So hypercapnic respiratory failure is a syndrome. The syndrome is the finding of the signs and symptoms of a CO2 level that's too high, sort of indication of a failure of hemo homeostasis, an imbalance between the production of CO2 in the tissues and the ventilation, the alveolar ventilation leading to the CO2 level to go up. It's worth noting that, you know, so hypercapnia being the finding that defines hypercapnia is a finding that's really just defined in terms of the distributions of normal. And so the normal CO2, of course, at elevation is lower than it is at sea level. And so because it's a definition that's just based on normality and not prognosis like we do with blood pressure, that means that the normal range is shifted at elevation. And so there's really no good reason not to use a definition of 41 to 42 at Salt Lake. Of course, insurers, coverage, billers don't necessarily understand that nuance. And so the qualifications for, say, devices and such don't use any elevation adjustment. You know, clinically, probably not such a huge deal because the cases that are borderline are less important to recognize. But when we're thinking about, you know, what a CO2 level means in a patient in clinic that, say, has a CO2 of 43 or 44, you know, that is abnormal. And the only other thing I'll mention is, you know, the finding of hypercapnia is really the only diagnostic criteria for hypercapnic respiratory failure. You know, in the hypothetical space of things we're interested in, it seems like there should be other criteria, such as for it to be failure, that the respiratory system isn't just responding appropriately to a metabolic alkalosis, which would be more of a respiratory success than a respiratory failure. That said, data from Trinetics suggested that that's actually very, very uncommon for folks to have overt hypercapnia only as a response to metabolic alkalosis. And so functionally, the syndrome is pretty much just defined by a high CO2 level. So to break down a bit about how I approach ventilatory failure being a better and more descriptive term than hypercapnic respiratory failure, because you can have a failure of homeostasis without overt hypercapnia if the situation calls for lower. So I'm going to give you a little bit more that just to review a moment. So this article is, I think, the best one, at least that I know of, that sort of gives a schema for how one should approach problems with ventilation. And the framework is, can you sustain what you need? Meaning a supply versus demand framework. And so if you think of the demand or the required ventilation, it depends on three different characteristics. You know, one is the dead space fraction or the proportion of each breath that's wasted and doesn't participate in gas exchange of CO2, the tissue tissue production of CO2 and the PaCO2 target that the situation calls for. And so I know variable enthusiasm for math, but I think you can just think about this in terms of how the direct, how the variables relate to each other. So, of course, if there's a bigger amount of ventilation wasted, you're going to have to require more ventilation to achieve the same goals. If there's more tissue production, there's going to have to be a proportional increase in ventilation. And then when there's a lower target, there's going to be a geometric increase in the amount of ventilation that's required to hit that lower target. On the other end of the supply-based demand is how much ventilation can the patient sustain. And so that's, you know, a more complex function of the muscle capacity to do work, meaning how strong are the muscles and what's their mechanical, at disadvantage, the stability of the respiratory control system, and then what loads are present on the respiratory system. And so whenever there's an imbalance in the required ventilation that the situation calls for, and the maximal sustainable ventilation of the patient, you have ventilatory failure. And so if we just kind of go through what some of those physiologic indicators would be, of course, ventilation wasted or the dead space fraction is primarily things like parenchyma lung disease or pulmonary vascular disease, or the anatomic dead space or equipment dead space if you're thinking about somebody that's already on a ventilator. The CO2 production, you know, certainly patients at rest have less of a range of this, although occasionally we'll get an overdose of a metabolic influence or something like a stimulant. You know, obese patients just have a larger CO2 production, and that's one of the mechanisms that can lead to a higher required ventilation. And then, of course, lastly, the goal, PACO2, reflecting the compensation to either metabolic acidosis or alkalosis. On the other end of the spectrum, again, the muscle capacity, mechanical advantage, those are things that are abnormal, particularly in, say, neuromuscular disease, COPD, or obstructive lung disease with hyperinflation, or pleural diseases that are making the chest wall stiffer, or the less smooth transfer of power from the muscles to the lung. Control stability is actually an area that is surprisingly poorly understood, but certainly we know opiates and sleep change that. And then the thing that we probably think the most of and probably does have the most easily intervenable things are what loads are the respiratory system experiencing. So resistive loads being, you know, breathing through a straw, the amount of effort that you feel blowing against that is all resistive, the elastic work being the representative energy that it takes to inflate a stiffer lung, and that threshold and inertial can play more of a role when folks are acutely ill on the vent. And so as we think about, you know, which patients are the ones that are at highest risk, you know, you can imagine patients existing in a different state where the, depending on sort of the chronic loads on the system, the required ventilatory target may be closer or further away from that maximal amount that they can sustain. And that in that case, the, they may have less wiggle room. And so we all have taken care of patients that, you know, say have a COPD with a FEV1 that's substantially less than a liter, and that it's very tough for those patients to stay out of the hospital because even a small change to their respiratory or their ventilatory demand will make it so that they're no longer able to meet it. And those are going to be patients that need close attention, all of the eye care study. So that's the sort of schema that I use in terms of thinking about patients and their risk. You know, I think it is worth dwelling a little bit on how the body determines this goal, PaCO2. And, you know, just mathematically returning to that equation from earlier, you know, we can see that the higher the PaCO2 target, the less required ventilation, right, which is a little bit counterintuitive in that folks usually think of having a high CO2 as a bad thing. And it certainly does indicate that the respiratory system is responding to something. That said, having a high blood CO2 level does make the lung effect more efficient because each breath that you exhale can be a higher concentration of CO2. And so it takes less overall alveolar ventilation to maintain steady state, you know. And so in a way, that's why we do lung protective ventilation with permissive hypercapnia is because if you allow the CO2 level to rise, you can reduce the amount of pressure that you're putting on the ventilator. And there's good evidence from both ECMO and folks with kidney injury that for a given CO2 level rise, that the absence of metabolic alkalosis compensation does pretend a worse prognosis in ARDS, partly because it's a multiple organ failure, but also likely partly because it means that the lungs are going to be continually exposed to bigger stressors. You know, and so it's worth reflecting, well, if having higher blood CO2 allows the lungs to be more efficient and that you can maintain a pH at any PaCO2, you just have to have the kidneys compensate. You know, so why is it that the body chose to, you know, at sea level have a 32 millimeters of mercury set point and not something higher? There's no reason why, or there's no obvious reason why somebody couldn't have a CO2 of 90 and a bicarb of 45 and that the lungs would have to do, you know, half as much work. And, you know, I think the reason to think about this is that even though that would make things more efficient, it would lower the oxygenation buffer, right, with our alveolar gas equation, that when your CO2 takes up space in the lungs, it displaces oxygen's ability to bind there. And so probably with an FiO2 of 21, the optimal set point here is some balance between how much oxygenation am I going to leave for the blood to maintain a little bit of extra buffer versus what I can sacrifice. And so the process by which somebody turns from an acute into a chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure, it appears that the respiratory control system is doing some calculation of how much work is it going to take to maintain this standard 32 and, you know, at least teleologically balancing those considerations. And that particularly in chronic respiratory failure, that makes it so they can't breathe, won't breathe. Classification really doesn't hold at all. It's not helpful. And then, you know, I think it's worth reflecting on this, that hypercapnic respiratory failure, at least severe hypercapnic, is a recent phenomenon. You know, until the medical advent of oxygen, there really was no possibility of becoming hypercapnic without also being dead. And so the, you know, ability to tolerate high CO2 levels is new. And, you know, that it is only 75 years that people had any idea this was a thing. And that Hannah Wunsch's book, who I highly recommend if folks haven't read it, goes through the story of how even in the beginning of polio, folks thought that folks were getting sleepy and becoming unresponsive because the polio virus was causing an encephalitis that they used to call cerebrillia until somebody decided to give sort of manual bagged breaths and people woke up. They realized, oh, actually, this is CO2 that's causing that. So a great story, the start of modern critical care, and so certainly of interest to this group. So transitioning gears a little bit away from the schemas and into research and clinical gaps. So, you know, I want to sort of argue that hypercapnic respiratory failure management is, you know, a big problem that warrants some attention. It's also a solvable problem, but there are very little resources being spent to this, which is also an opportunity for us to do good work that influences a lot of folks. There are a handful of data that weigh in on the question of how common hypercapnic respiratory failure is. One group from Australia published an article in the Blue Journal two years or so ago where they took an area in Australia that is serviced by one hospital and took all the blood gases that were obtained at admission for acute or emergency room visits and then standardized it to the population of the serviced area to extrapolate a population sort of period prevalence over a year. And what they came out with was 150 per 100,000 years. And so just by way of reference, that's a bit higher than, say, decompensated cirrhosis in the U.S., which is roughly 100 per 100,000. You know, of course, a big limitation to that study is we don't know exactly how reliable people get blood gases in everybody that has hypercapnia, but there's reason to suspect it's not very good. The only study that I'm aware of that's ever done essentially blood gases on folks who didn't have a clinical indication for it for the purpose of trying to understand how common incidental or unrecognized hypercapnia is was a 20-year-old study done at the Denver VA where they found that among people with severe obesities at the Denver VA, about a third of folks had elevation-adjusted hypercapnia, if you checked, and that only about one in 10 of those folks were recognized in clinical care. Granted, things have changed in the last 20 years, but I'm doubtful that our screening is that much better. Our group used the Utah population database to get a similar estimate, and so I looked at sort of the pre-COVID yearly period prevalence of ICD codes for hypercapnic respiratory failure in Utah, and so there's about 4,000 to 5,000, at least during that period, ICD codes out of one of the five main ones, and if you normalize that to the population of Utah, again, it kind of comes out in this roughly 150,000 or 150 per 100,000 ballpark. This one, we do have some evidence, though, to say that data from Trinetix, which aggregates health records from across the country, a manuscript that thankfully actually just got accepted to CHEST over the weekend, we looked at out of the folks that have blood gases that show hypercapnic respiratory failure and how many of them get an ICD code ultimately, and as you can see from these splines that sort of model as the CO2 increases, you know, in the emergency room, roughly a third of folks that are hypercapnic by an arterial blood gas end up getting an ICD code, and that inpatient it sort of plateaus around 40 percent, which means that there's substantially more people in Utah that are having blood gases showing hypercapnia than there are that are getting ICD codes, and so this may be an underestimate by, you know, a factor of up to three or so. The, you know, I think you can make an argument to say, well, a lot of those folks, it's somewhat either incidental or situational findings that lead to their hypercapnia, you know, meaning if I'm, get ill, get intubated, somebody's not paying super close attention to the vent, and I'm deeply sedated, and I get a CO2 of 50, that doesn't necessarily indicate an ongoing predisposition to, you know, respiratory frailty, and that is true. That said, there is a burgeoning literature on how do these patients do that actually shows that, irrespective of exactly why you have hypercapnic respiratory failure, your risk of bad things happening is quite high, and so this is a retrospective review of a single facility in Vermont where they looked at everybody that had gotten an ICD code for hypercapnic respiratory failure, and they found, you know, basically one in four 30-day readmission rate, which, you know, is similar to heart failure and COPD. It's a bit more than myocardial infarction nowadays, and that two out of the three were readmitted for recurrent hypercapnia, and so a quite high burden, and that that burden is true regardless whether folks are compensated or not, and so on the right is an annals of ATS paper where they looked at the, in the Michigan health system, everybody that had had a blood gas that showed a compensated hypercapnia and looked at mortality, and just for sort of reference again, I've used decompensated cirrhosis to say that the middle line there, which is the CO2 in the 55, the 50 to 55, or 55 to 65 range, roughly prognostic equivalent to having decompensated cirrhosis, and if you have a higher CO2 level, it's worse, more mild being a little bit better, and then we found essentially the same rough trajectory in that same Trinetix database that I mentioned earlier, that out of the 30,000 folks that had hypercapnic respiratory failure diagnosis codes, you know, an average age of only 65, but a two-month mortality of 20%, and a, you know, with a median follow-up of nine months, 30% mortality rate, that gets us into a similar ballpark as these findings. So, you know, the last thing that I'll mention about the prognostic implications is that I really think these patients are quite expensive for the healthcare system to care for. There's been at least two Office of the Inspector General reports on the costs of home mechanical ventilators and non-invasive respiratory-assist devices, and as you can see from this chart, that, you know, starting in around 2013, the frequency in terms of, compared to the 2009 baseline, you know, more than a hundred-fold increase in the utilization of this equipment, but there aren't necessarily good overall estimates of costs, which is why, actually, one of the first research projects that we're initiating with the Pulmonary Critical Care Medicine seed grant funding is an economic analysis of who, of overall costs, where we're linking Intermountain Health record data and select health, and so David Hedges, Ryland Fowler, and of course Sam Brown are helping me to assist with that, which is a project that we're calling AIM High, that we're going to start with hypercapnic respiratory failure, but look at other potentially high utilization disease sets and try to use some machine learning to predict which folks are at highest risk so that we can intervene. So more to come there. You know, this would be a sort of sad talk if there was nothing to do about it, but I think therapeutic options do exist, and this is a subfield that has sort of weak evidence in general, although I'll say, you know, there is some good evidence, and there's good guideline recommendations that are appropriately, generally not all that strong. So of course, the obesity hyperventilation guidelines suggest that folks should be treated for OHS. You know, that is a surprisingly very low level of evidence. You know, that said, there are actually randomized control trials in neuromuscular weakness, also CF, not pictured here, and then I'm not going to do a deep dive today unless folks are interested in it on the long-term non-invasive ventilation for chronic stable hypercapnic respiratory failure. That said, there's a dozen or so trials that are generally supportive of hypercapnic respiratory failure if done appropriately, but I don't think it's all NIV. I think there's two other main things that these patients need that they don't get. You know, one, I'll point to prior work that I've done on obesity management for particularly the sleep disordered breathing component of hypercapnia, and so folks may know that the FDA has approved their hepatite for obstructive sleep apnea now and that we did a meta-analysis of all weight loss interventions and showed a dose-dependent finding of OSA improvement with weight loss interventions, both surgical and medical, and that, you know, the precise attributable fraction of sleep apnea to hypercapnia isn't really known, but I'll say, you know, there's been a handful of cohorts, five, that have, you know, looked and said routine screening for sleep apnea after patients present with hypercapnia respiratory failure to the ICU, and the majority of folks have moderate to severe sleep apnea, and so I think there's a case, and, you know, we need greater data, but very likely that sleep apnea is bringing a pretty big causal role, even in folks that don't strictly meet the definition for OHS, and that, you know, because of all of this, there is a growing movement to sort of formalize chronic respiratory failure as a new subspecialty. This was, again, in the annals last year, all right, and, you know, essentially the argument being, you know, there's only about 300 folks nationwide who really specialize in chronic respiratory failure, which is probably not sufficient to meet the needs of patients who now live longer, you know, in the example of neuromuscular disease, and that taking care of these patients, yeah, takes unique, both skill set in terms of the chronic vent management, but even more than that, just processes of care that the burdens on DME equipment ordering and respiratory therapy support to facilitate good care are quite high. I will talk about that a little bit more, with the idea being that sort of formal subspecialty designation could help both solidify the research paradigm and facilitate advocation for sort of structural changes there. So I'm going to use that to hop into the holes that I think we can address in what we're doing with the funding and that sort of how I anticipate that translating into improvements in hypercapnic respiratory failure care. And so I would break this down really as two main problems with that evidence base. So as I mentioned, there are a handful of guidelines that are based on variable quality, but, you know, some randomized trials that pertain to folks that have single-cause hypercapnic respiratory failure. So, you know, if you look at the trials of folks that had hypercapnic COPD, the average BMI is 25. They exclude folks that have comorbid sleep apnea. Conversely, the definition of obesity hypoventilation syndrome defines a way multi-causal, you know, that has to be caused by obesity in the absence of all the other contributors. So what is heart failure and COPD? If there's a little bit of that, all of a sudden it becomes not OHS. It's not a good definition. And so it makes it hard to extrapolate, you know, what do I do with a patient that's maybe got COPD, heart failure, and sleep disordered breathing? None of those evidence bases really apply to that patient. So the truth is we don't totally know what we should do with those patients. And we have to make extrapolations. So that's sort of the first problem is that there's a big group of patients that the guidelines really don't apply to. You know, I think the second problem, which is even a bigger problem, is that all of this evidence base is predicated on having a definitive diagnosis, which is usually not what occurs in reality. And so, you know, the traditional paradigm that's implied by these guidelines is that, you know, you have a patient, they have outpatient spirometry, they've done a COPD, or they've been diagnosed with COPD, they're getting followed, the disease status worsens until eventually they have a hypercapnic respiratory failure exacerbation. And then, you know, on discharge and in the two weeks following up their discharge, the providers know, hey, this patient has COPD, now it's hypercapnic, we're going to use this guideline to say what to do. I think what actually happens is oftentimes this patient population isn't strongly established with outpatient providers, they haven't had any relevant prior testing, and they show up to the hospital with an exacerbation of hypercapnic respiratory failure, they're stabilized, and so now they're being discharged, and we don't tend to get spirometry in the hospital, we don't tend to get sleep apnea testing, we can get echocardiogram testing, at least looking for heart failure, but so that means that that initial diagnosis is both empiric and there's a transition of care to the outpatient providers that are going to manage that issue, which is an opportunity for people to fall through the cracks. And so we looked at this with a research project that I presented at ATS here where we suspected, hey, I think, looking statewide, that folks are likely to have low rates of testing for the different causes of hypercapnic respiratory failure. And so, you know, this work is predicated to say we don't know exactly how we should manage folks that have had a hospitalization for hypercapnic respiratory failure, but I don't think it's too much of a stretch to say they should have the testing to figure out what the cause of their hypercapnic respiratory failure was. And so what we did was we looked at the Utah Population Database and specifically the All-Payer Claims Database, which covers claims from about 90% of commercially insured patients in the state and about 70% of their remaining care in, again, that pre-COVID period. And we looked at inpatient and emergency room encounters where folks got a diagnosis of hypercapnic respiratory failure. And that, as you can see from these charts, in the five years before the presentation, you know, about two-thirds of folks with any of the diagnosis codes had had an echocardiogram testing, but only about one in three had had PFTs and about one in five had had sleep apnea testing, and those are ascertained by the billing codes for those tests anywhere in the state. You know, granted, this does make the assumption that folks just hadn't moved in from the state, so I think probably somewhat of an underestimate. But I think the really sobering thing is the rates are much, much worse in the year after, including the index hospitalization. So about half get an echocardiogram, and I think that reflects the much easier ability to get those tests, but closer to one in eight and one in 10 get either PFTs or sleep apnea tests in that year after, which suggests to me that there is a big gap here. And so this is a sort of preliminary finding in that the second big initiative that the seed grant is going to support is a cohort that we're calling the CO2 path or post-acute trajectories and hypercapnia cohort, which is to say you can actually do some good defining of the denominator to capture this group and then following their trajectories after a hospitalization with hypercapnia. You know, because I think the real big question is, you know, one, how good is the health system doing at actually working up patients that come in with hypercapnic respiratory failure? And then two, we really want to tease out, you know, is this just a marker of who is extremely frail or is this something where if we intervene on ventilation, we can really help to ameliorate those risks? And so that's the purpose of the cohort. And so, you know, what does this imply? You know, I think it's a little sobering to think of exactly what the usual care post-discharge workup is for somebody that gets diagnosed with hypercapnia and, you know, maybe a hypercapnic respiratory failure and only preliminary diagnosis, you know, is that their inpatient team, you know, say they decide to prescribe a home mechanical ventilator. You know, if they do that, in order to get that equipment, there's a discharge, there's an order that goes from the inpatient team to the DME company who receives the order. They send a respiratory therapist out to help set it up. That respiratory therapist is supposed to educate the family on how it's done, but it doesn't necessarily mean they're going to get any advising from a physician in terms of how things work. You know, they're going to place a referral. Thankfully, we have the pulmonary disease navigators which make things much better, but there's a referral to the PDM, scheduling with a pulmonary provider. They tend to get the PFTs before the provider visit, and so lots of these steps have to happen before they're actually discussing their care with the pulmonary provider. And something similar happening with, if anything, is even harder for our sleep colleagues because often the patients don't understand, you know, I came in because I couldn't breathe during the day. why are you focused on their sleep and that all of those things are often happening before they're even talking to anybody. And so it shouldn't be surprising to us that extremely low rates of completed care happen. And I think that implies, you know, a couple things about why we ought to approach things the ways that we are. You know, one is that we do really need to understand a little bit better what's happening now, and that is the goal of that CO2 path cohort. And then the other thing is that, you know, if you extrapolate out from that ICD code data that I have, you know, I would estimate there's somewhere between 5,000 or 6,000 cases of hypercapnic respiratory failure that come in in acute care or emergency room in the Intermountain system. Obviously, not all of those patients really need to see a specialist. Some of them are epiphenomena. Some of them are of general critical illness. Some of them are transient caused by iatrogenic factors. Some of them can be managed by general pulmonologists or maybe even primary care. That said, we need to figure out who are the patients that really are at high risk of coming back into the hospital if somebody doesn't intervene. And that's the goal of that AIM-HI study that we're linking the Select Health and Intermountain data from. And so switching gears just a little bit to end, you know, with what we're doing in my clinic down in the Schmidt Clinic. So as it is, I am the majority of the time sort of taking care of folks that have chronic respiratory failure. I think as it is right now, our three main referral streams is, you know, the single biggest one I think is the high risk post-discharge coming through Claire Davies and Megan Hepworth down in the Schmidt Chest Clinic. Yeah, I do have a good number of referrals from folks who see one of the other providers down in Schmidt Clinic and that we either have a co-management or a transfer of care and that all manage their NIV. And then working particularly with Dr. Hunter and Google Slots on neuromuscular patients. You know, we don't have an ALS center here at Intermountain, so that patient population we're still sending up to the university, but other folks with neuromuscular weakness are coming to my clinic. You know, I think we could definitely take more patients from a few other sources. I think PM&R, things like spinal cord injuries, folks who get discharged to a facility first are harder to capture because they don't have that immediate step where there's a natural place for them to meet Claire or Megan. And then I do think there's a potential, I think a lot of folks get sort of, you know, suspected OHS and sent to sleep where sleep does tests and, you know, determines actually this really isn't a primary sleep breathing issue and that we probably, you know, I think it probably would be a good idea in the future for us to get a good workflow there. You know, one last thing that I think could be done well and that will take a little bit of building and triage is, you know, a lot of the chronic respiratory failure can actually be managed pretty well remotely in that, you know, the remote tracking downloads give a huge amount of information and the combination of talking with a patient on a video visit and getting the respiratory information off the remote tracking download can actually give a pretty good fidelity care and so I think there's a lot of growth potential for the clinic in terms of geographic dispersion throughout the system. So, in our last bit here, what I am going to do is talk a bit about the new device qualifications for respiratory assist devices and home mechanical ventilators and so just as a quick review on those terms. So, respiratory assist device is essentially a made-up term that back when sleep apnea treatment was first discovered they had CPAPs and separately ventilators of the kind that were used in the hospital and CMS was understandably very worried that there's a huge burden of sleep apnea out there. They didn't want to get footed with the bill of playing for home ventilators for that entire population and so in order to get CMS on board to cover CPAPs, BiPAPs related devices the community made up the term respiratory assist device to sort of say we're not planning on getting everybody home ventilators and so as it turns out the technology has gotten way way better in the last 25 years or so and so now these respiratory assist devices can actually do most things that you would expect from a home ventilator so BiPAP BiPAP with a backup rate volume assured pressure support so volume targeted pressure support you can do all of those with a respiratory assist device that said there are still some things where you really need a full home mechanical ventilator and so if you want AVAPs with an adjustable EPAP AVAPs AE being the most common mode for that that has to be done with a home mechanical ventilator or if you want these other modalities often used in severe disease those need to happen with a home mechanical ventilator the maximum pressures on most respiratory assist devices are 30 or below which seems pretty dang high although you do have to remember that the mean inspiratory pressure for the COPD more recent COPD trials you know that the means of those are in the 25 range and that you know a good one in four of the patients are having iPAPs over 30 and that just reflects that you really do have to use high pressure to make it comfortable and effective specifically in the folks that have COPD respiratory assist devices I can just log on to the remote tracking system and change the settings whereas that's not allowed with a home mechanical ventilator there's a different difference in cost in that the folks with a respiratory assist device will eventually own that device and that the home mechanical ventilators come with respiratory therapy support and so they are partly paying for that ability to have somebody around to troubleshoot and so starting with respiratory assist devices folks may sort of have come across these you know that there was restrictive thoracic disorders which required one pathway hypercapnic COPD required a different one and hypoventilation required yet a different one and these criteria were often annoying you know for example there was a requirement with a COPD version to say that folks had to be hypoxemic for a certain number of nights which both doesn't make any sense because you know the indication has nothing to do with hypoxemia and then specifically here almost none of our patients are not hypoxemic for part of the night certainly if they have bad enough COPD to be considered for this and so they ended up on a lot of sort of superfluous testing that didn't really help and so they've been a long-standing effort to revisit these which CMS in a national coverage determination approved just in the last two months a new one and so I'll say there's no change to the neuromuscular criteria which are relatively well-founded and so you can get one of those if folks have a neuromuscular disease and then one of either overt hypercapnia hypoxemia at night or spirometry that suggests that they'd benefit the COPD one has changed and you know one thing to keep in mind is COPD is now a bucket that includes all chronic respiratory failure not just COPD this is annoying and it's going to be confusing for trainees for sure but that there's two different pathways there's one to get respiratory assist device for stable outpatients and one to get it on discharge from the hospital and so the outpatient criteria actually doesn't require COPD you just have to no PFTs which is why you know say somebody has severe IPF and is hypercapnic they'd still get the respiratory assist through a COPD pathway and that in the outpatient setting you have to have stable CO2 over 52 no elevation adjustment for this and that you have to make a determination that sleep apnea isn't the sole cause which doesn't have to be on the basis of a polysomnography or a nocturnal oximetry again on discharge again no PFTs required you do have to document the full settings of respiratory assist device use within 24 hours of discharge and so for the hospitalist teams that means that the residents are going to have to put all of the settings in the discharge notes which is likely going to take some education and then it has to be determined that you need a respiratory assist device to avoid either symptoms or rapid CO2 rise it's not exactly clear how one determines that there aren't specific criteria other than that you have to put that you think that in the note the other big change for this is that folks are going to need to meet continued usage criteria every six months and that those are among other things going to say that you have to use it for an average of five hours per 24 hour period and then have some documented improvement in either CO2 exacerbations or symptoms and so that does mean that all of these patients are going to have to be seen every six months by somebody probably me which will make our clinic certainly busier but we'll have to figure out ways to adjust to that similarly the home mechanical ventilators actually had an easier qualification approach and that for that folks had you know that you could say I think this patient has blank disease and that they have a condition life-threatening where interruption of respiratory support would quickly lead to serious harm or death and that was enough to qualify folks for a home mechanical ventilator and so that's obviously much less of a onerous testing regime than the respiratory assist devices and so this had fueled a huge increase in the use of home mechanical ventilators not because folks really needed it but because it was all that people could get because of the onerous respiratory assist device qualifications you know that has changed some too so again there's no change to the neuromuscular disease home mechanical ventilation and again COPD is now a blanket that encompasses all non-neuromuscular hypercapnic respiratory failure and non-OIP tests and so folks for the outpatient pathway have to qualify for the RAD and then meet one of these additional criteria of either need an advanced mode IPAPs that are higher or the respiratory assist device hadn't worked and then you know for us needing more than 36% FIO2 or about 4 liters is another you know we need one of that box and one of the lower box you know on discharge again it's mainly that the capabilities exceed the respiratory assist device and that the inpatient team has used the home mechanical ventilator within 24 hours and they need again full settings on there to qualify in that route and then the same overall stop and so that takes me to time the main you know and so just you know if you're interested in collaborating on hypercapnia research or have ideas for referrals or specific patients to send my way shoot me a message either in my central or soon in epic or on email happy to chat about any of this stuff you know acknowledging big team here I mentioned the funders earlier up at the start of course the as I hopefully gave the sense of the chronic respiratory clinic is at least as much a respiratory therapist clinic as it is a MD clinic and so as it is right now Claire and Megan do a whole lot of heavy lifting for this and then of course a broad research team from Intermountain Select Health the University and University of Utah so with that I'll go ahead and switch gears and take questions if folks have them thanks so much\n"
